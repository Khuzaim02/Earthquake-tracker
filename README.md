# Earthquake-tracker
A modern, high-performance earthquake monitoring application built with a scalable frontend architecture using React, Vite, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. Designed for real-time data visualization and responsive UI across devices, this project demonstrates expertise in building production-ready SPAs with modular design and clean code practices.

🚀 Tech Stack

Frontend

    React (Hooks + JSX): Component-based UI with declarative rendering

    TypeScript: Strongly typed JavaScript for better tooling and maintainability

    Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid and responsive UI styling

Build Tool

    Vite: Lightning-fast development server and optimized production build

State Management

    React useState & useEffect: Local component state (scalable with Redux, Zustand, etc.)

API Handling

    Native fetch() API: Consumes live earthquake data from public APIs like USGS or EMSC

Deployment (Planned)

    Microsoft azure, aws

Features    

    🌐 Fetches real-time earthquake data from public APIs (e.g., USGS)

    🧭 Displays earthquake data in both map-based and list-based UIs (planned for v2)

    🧩 Modular component structure with reusable design patterns

    🔄 Auto-refresh or refresh-on-click for updated seismic info

    📱 Fully responsive design (mobile-first) using Tailwind’s grid & flex utilities

    🧪 Type-safe, maintainable, and scalable codebase ideal for teams

🛠️ Developer Highlights

    ✔️ Built with industry-standard tools and modern JavaScript practices

    ✔️ Clean code architecture following separation of concerns

    ✔️ Strong focus on performance, maintainability, and scalability

    ✔️ Easily extendable: can integrate maps, push notifications, and historical data graphs

📈 Future Enhancements

    🌍 Interactive Map using Leaflet.js or Google Maps API

    📊 Earthquake magnitude filters & charts (Recharts/D3.js)

    🔔 Real-time alerts with push notification support

    🗃️ Offline support with service workers (PWA version)

    🔐 User login & saved location preferences
